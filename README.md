hi, i'm Jinay, an aspiring software engineer in Ontario👋

i am currently a senior at Turner Fenton SS, in the IB program. incoming at uwaterloo cs🧠 

in the past year, i have been able to build various projects and get into AI and web development. 

my recent projects include💡:
- uinvestor📈: an easy-to-use stock simulator to break the barrier to investment for teens: 
- freshvision🍃: a fridge sensor that uses computer vision to detect decaying fruits in real-time, providing a notification to the user upon discovery of rotting food. projected to reduce household fruit waste by 90% in the average Canadian household. 
- hopelink🔗: a helpful tool in apocalyptic situations that links regions through a resource network. uses real-time location to pinpoint sources of food, water and other wanted resources. working toward implementing an offline mesh network.
